Overwatch Exclusive Pick/Ban by @Cactus_Puppy | Team captains are decided by the first player to press Crouch + Interact. Once both teams have a captain, teams will alternate banning. From the remaining heroes, teams will alternate drafting. Heroes can be selected by the team captain by selecting the hero then pressing Crouch + Interact. If the timer for a ban phase runs out without a ban, no hero will be banned; if it is on a draft phase, a random remaining hero is picked.
